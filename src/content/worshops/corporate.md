I collaborate with companies and organizations to offer bespoke yoga and wellbeing workshops tailored to the needs of modern workplaces. Sessions can incorporate meditation, breathwork, and thoughtfully guided movement — all designed to ease stress, support mental clarity, and foster a sense of balance and resilience.

- **Creativity Meditation**  
  A guided mindfulness practice to enhance creativity and expand inner landscapes. Ideal for teams looking to make space for fresh, inspired ideas.

- **Espresso Yoga**  
  An energising, one-shot yoga flow to boost energy and focus. Perfect for a morning or midday pick-me-up!

- **Desk Kit**  
  Simple movements and techniques to relieve neck and back tension, reduce eye strain, and ease mental fatigue — right from the desk.

- **Vibe & Unwind**  
  A soothing blend of slow flow, meditation, and breathwork to calm the nervous system and promote deep relaxation.
