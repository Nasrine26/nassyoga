**Sunday 10am | Vinyasa To The Beat - all levels**

The heart of the dynamic practice is the alignment of the breath to the beat of the music. Move to the beat. Connect. Reset. Be still. 
These Vinyasa classes are playful, uplifting and leave you feeling higher and stronger. Expect sun salutations to warm the body, various standing and seated postures to strengthen, including backbends, forward folds, and hip openers - all the while syncing breath to beat. Float away with a smile.

See you on the mat!
