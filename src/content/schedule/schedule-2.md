We flow through the moving meditation that is breath. Move to the beat. Connect. Reset. Be still. 
These Vinyasa classes are playful, uplifting and leave you feeling higher and stronger. Expect sun salutations to warm the body, various standing and seated postures to strengthen, including backbends, forward folds, and hip openers - all the while syncing breath to beat. Float away with a smile.

See you on the mat!
