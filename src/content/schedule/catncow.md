**Friday 11am | Dynamic Vinyasa**

A challenging and playful Vinyasa class to work the entire body, focusing on balancing and building strength, stamina and flexibility. Expect to generate lots of internal heat within the body as you work deeper into the breath.

Suitable for all levels

**Friday 12pm | Slow Flow**

Transitioning into gentle movement mixed with stillness. With a focus on softening and targeting different areas of the body, this class invites you to explore your inner landscape, making space for self-study and introspection.

Suitable for all levels

**Sunday 12pm | Vinyasa To The Beat**

The heart of the dynamic practice is the alignment of the breath to the beat of the music. Sync your breath to the beat of the music in this moving meditation. Embrace sun salutations to warm the body, and various standing and seated postures to strengthen and build stamina, including backbends, forward folds, and hip openers - all the while flowing to a beat that lifts your spirit.
