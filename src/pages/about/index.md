A little bit about me...

Hello, I’m Nasrine!

Yoga has always been an integral part of my life - on and off the mat - from an early age thanks to my mom and grandmother. After seven years of practice, I chose to deepen my journey by becoming an accredited Vinyasa and Hatha Yoga Teacher. With a background in Life Sciences, I bring a unique understanding of health, wellbeing, and the human
body to my teaching. In my classes, I guide students to cultivate a deeper connection to themselves. By consciously flowing with our breath, we learn to soften, let go, and rediscover inner peace. Through mindful movement, we create space for healing, self-awareness and transformation. 

My teaching philosophy is grounded in the balance between gentleness, strength, kindness, and listening to one’s body. A moment of reconnection with self through meditation, pranayama and postural practice. 

My motto: Align. Breathe. Connect
