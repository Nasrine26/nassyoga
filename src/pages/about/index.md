    <h2>A little bit about me...</h2>
    <p>Hello, Iâ€™m <strong><span style="color: #9C5648;">Nasrine!</span></strong></p>
    <p>Yoga has always been an integral part of my life - on and off the mat - from an early age thanks to my mom and grandmother.
    After seven years of practice, I trained in Vinyasa and Hatha Yoga and have carried on training in 4Beat methodology developed by Marcus Veda. With a strong background in Life Sciences, I bring a unique understanding of health, wellbeing, and the human body to my teaching. By consciously flowing with our breath and music, we learn to soften, let go, and rediscover inner peace.
    Through mindful movement and moving meditation that is the breath, we create space for self-awareness and transformation.
  </p>
  <p>
    My teaching philosophy is grounded in the balance between gentleness and strength through meditation, pranayama and postural practice, exploring the relationship between body and mind through the breath. Dynamic, playful, inclusive - a moment of reconnection with self.
    </p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: #9C5648;">My motto: Move. Breathe. Connect.</strong></p>

  <p>"Yoga allows you to find a new kind of freedom that you may not know even existed." - B.K.S Iyengar
