    <h2>A little bit about me...</h2>
    <p>Hello, I’m <strong><span style="color: #9C5648;">Nasrine!</span></strong></p>
    <p>Yoga has always been an integral part of my life - on and off the mat - from an early age thanks to my mom and grandmother.
    After seven years of practice, I chose to deepen my journey by becoming an accredited Vinyasa and Hatha Yoga Teacher. I have also carried on training in 4Beat with Marcus Veda, Emily Mergaert, Nino Russo, Fiona Callanan and Zo Rahm. With a background in Life Sciences, I bring a unique understanding of health, wellbeing, and the human body to my teaching. In my classes, I guide students to cultivate a deeper connection to themselves.
    By consciously flowing with our breath and music, we learn to soften, let go, and rediscover inner peace.
    Through mindful movement and moving meditation through the breath, we create space for healing, self-awareness and transformation.
  </p>
  <p>
    My teaching philosophy is grounded in the balance between gentleness, strength, kindness, and listening to one’s body. Dynamic, playful, inclusive.
    A moment of reconnection with self through meditation, pranayama and postural practice, maintaining a strong focus on the breath.
    </p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: #9C5648;">My motto: Move. Breathe. Connect.</strong></p>

  <p>"Yoga allows you to find a new kind of freedom that you may not know even existed." - B.K.S Iyengar
